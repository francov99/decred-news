The soft-fork implementation of Schnorr signatures and Taproot was [merged](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19953) to Bitcoin Core. { summary of what does it do }

{ governance, funding, chain forks, community splits }

Mario Laul of Placeholder identified [ten theses](https://medium.com/@mariolaul/ten-theses-on-decentralized-network-governance-c1a24a9d59c7) on decentralized network governance. This high level decomposition of core principles driving the networks gives another way to look at Decred.

> good network governance aligns the interests of all stakeholders through a sufficiently flexible system of checks and balances. Imbalanced governance or inability to resolve conflicts between key stakeholders creates instability, which is particularly problematic for networks positioned to become systemically important administrative infrastructure with a very large user base.

{ DEX }

A paper on atomic swaps between Bitcoin and Monero was [published](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126) in September and a corresponding [proposal](https://ccs.getmonero.org/proposals/h4sh3d-atomic-swap-implementation.html) was funded on Monero's Community Crowdfunding System, raising 2.7K XMR ($340K) in just 4 days. Another group [iterated](https://medium.com/comit-network/monero-bitcoin-atomic-swap-1cab015d7af9) further on the protocol to use simple 2-of-2 multisig scripts for Bitcoin.

{ relevant exchanges and websites }

{ other: regulations, privacy, security, fun }

CFTC [charged](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8270-20) BitMEX owners for operating an unregistered trading platform and violating CFTC regulations, including failing to implement AML procedures.

Komodo [announced](https://komodoplatform.com/community-update-on-atomicdex-kyc-aml/) that they will be implementing KYC/AML procedures on the AtomicDEX liquidity network that is officially supported by the developers, even though the exchange is non-custodial. The move comes in response to new regulation in some jurisdictions.

PayPal [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-new-york-conditional-bitlicense-paxos-cryptocurrency) that it will allow users to buy BTC, ETH, BCH and LTC with its app. The initial version will not allow deposits, withdrawals, or sending cryto to other PayPal accounts. The company has a [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) of arbitrarily frozen accounts and associated lawsuits.

Dustin Dreifuerst of [Did You Know Podcast](https://didyouknowcrypto.com/ep26/) warns of a [scenario](https://medium.com/@dustindreifuerst/the-coming-bitcoin-war-ff3e96db3aad) where an influx of institutional investment will lead to a conflict with principles crypto was founded on. { submitted in https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/147 , relevant enough? }

Tether [reversed](https://cryptobriefing.com/tether-can-freeze-destroy-your-usdt/) a $1 million transaction in September by a user who erroneously sent the funds to the DeFi platform Swerve.

GitHub has taken down the repository of the popular [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) project that allows to bypass all the UI nonsense and just get the video file from YouTube. For Decred this is a reminder of the risk to lose any GitHub data not sored in the Git repository, which is especially relevant for repositories like [dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) that have many design discussions and decisions stored in issues and pull requests outside of Git. The program can still be downloaded from its [website](https://youtube-dl.org/) (make sure the signatures are still valid) and used e.g. to backup Decred videos hosted on the centralized YouTube platform.

UK Government published an international [statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-statement-end-to-end-encryption-and-public-safety) on end-to-end encryption, co-signed by representatives from the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and Japan. The statement calls for tech companies to inject backdoors for public safety. Matrix team posted a [response](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/) explaining why compromising everyone's security and privacy to combat abuse by the minority of bad actors is fundamentally flawed and proposed alternative measures.
