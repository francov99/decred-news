## DCRDEX Release

{ high level status: GUI works? which pairs are up? is there a web page to check the action without installing anything? }

> I want to thank ALL of our earlier testers for your feedback and patience as we get this thing moving. We have taken a lot of the feedback into account, and resolved a number of UI/UX issues, and fixed a couple of bugs that have popped up in match recovery scenarios. ([@chappjc](https://matrix.to/#/!mlRZqBtfWHrcmgdTWB:decred.org/$AQsNUyN7WWfYR6IhOgtGckBAecXP5ASXCYKFBpNWrcM))

## Development

Unless otherwise noted, the work reported here has the "merged to master" status. It means that the work is completed, reviewed, and integrated into the source code that advanced users can build and run, but is not yet available in release binaries for regular users.

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

v1.6 Release Candidate 1 and 2 have been created for public testing. You can read the RC2 release notes and get the source code [here](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/releases/tag/release-v1.6.0-rc2). Bug reports are welcome at [issue tracker](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues).

Work included in v1.6 release:

- added ticket [exhaustion](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2398) check to prevent a theoretical scenario when the ticket pool goes too low and the chain can become unrecoverable if certain blocks are added
- fixed block template generation for [disapproved](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2397) blocks
- mining code changed to prioritize transactions with higher [aggregate fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1829) based on its ancestors in the mempool (aka Child Pays for Parent)
- multiple tweaks and fixes for the new treasury code
- tool for generating certificates [rewritten](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2425) to support more use cases (like not including hostname and interface in the certificate or specify any of the 4 supported algorithms)
- improved chain generation [test harness](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2329)
- fixed database [migration](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2446) to support upgrading from v1.4 { inferred from [this](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2446#pullrequestreview-515629122) comment, is this correct? }
- for upgrading from even older clients where the database is too old to migrate, redownloading the chain from scratch was [automated](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/2449) to not require any manual intervention from the user

Continued merged work past the v1.6 branching point:

- continued the saga to cover [rpcserver](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/2069) with tests
- `mining` package reorganized for easier testing and navigation

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet):

- allow wallet accounts to be individually [encrypted](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1823) and unlocked, each with its own passphrase { how does this play together with wallet's global public and private passphrase? i.e. is such account encrypted twice with account and then wallet passphrase? }
- better handling of [low](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1875) [balance](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1879) when purchasing tickets
- track [status](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1866) of vspd ticket fees to handle failures of fee processing by vspd
- multiple fixes for vspd staking { prs 1816,1819 are much harder to understand vs others }
- fixes for new `getminingstate` and `getinitstate` messages
- require [TLS certificate](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1867) authentication for gRPC clients, allow it for JSON-RPC clients (this is a more secure way for programs to talk to dcrwallet)
- allow gRPC clients to [lock/unlock](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1883) wallet and call methods without a [passphrase](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1880)
- commands to query and set [voting policy](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1897) for treasury transactions created by particular keys
- commands to set voting policy for specific [tspend](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1905) transactions

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton):

- LN [Watchtowers](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2638) support
- multiple UI/UX improvements for [LN views](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2641)
- initial auto [ticket buyer](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2577) for the new vspd
- manual ticket [purchasing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2729) with the new vspd
- initial integration of [CSPP](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2773) with ticket purchasing { any better way to put it? is it "purchasing tickets with mixed funds" or "Private Staking"? }
- [listing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2747) of vspd
- [migrated](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2705) from the deprecated [trezor.js](https://github.com/trezor/trezor.js) to Trezor [Connect API](https://github.com/trezor/connect) { does Decrediton make requests to connect.trezor.io now? }
- show SPV mode [icon](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2666) on the sidebar
- show [peer count](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2685) on the sidebar
- new tab for ticket [status](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2813)
- remember [last used](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2789) VSP
- highlight misplaced words on [seed entry](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2683) view
- use client TLS [certificate](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2715) to talk to dcrwallet
- updated [Portuguese](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2782) translation
- continued refactoring to functional components and CSS modules
- ~60 bug fixes

In progress:

- Trezor [staking](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2681) support. Since it might take a long time for the required [changes](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/pull/1249) in Trezor firmware to get merged, the developers have [decided](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/2681#issuecomment-714265711) to try our own custom firmware.
- automated UI [testing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/2659)

## Governance

In October the [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) received 12,388 DCR and spent 14,748 DCR. Using October's daily average DCR/USD rate of $12.01, this is $149K received and $177K spent. At September's average daily rate of $13.26, the USD figure billed for work completed in that month is $196K. As of Nov 4, Treasury balance is 638,044 DCR (7.9 million USD at $12.38).

The candidate proposals for the RFP proposal to change messaging on Decred.org (approved in Sep) were voted on, but none of these were approved. Results were as follows:

* D.R.E.A.M - 48% approval, turnout of 29%
* "Money Evolved" tagline with minimal changes to the site - 25% approval, turnout of 25%

* "Money Evolved" tagline - plus "Fair" box and page added to the site - 7% approval, turnout of 17%

A content and asset translation proposal was submitted in Oct and approved in early Nov with 75% approval and 28% turnout. This proposal will cover translation of Decred publications and assets into 6-8 languages, with a maximum budget of $33,000 to cover 6 months of work. The proposal is staffed by people who have a record of delivering translations of Decred content.

A pre-proposal from Paris Smithson for the WhyDecred.com site was discussed on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/jkmhbv/whydecredcom_proposal_open_talk/).

Imbalanced governance or inability to resolve conflicts between key stakeholders creates instability, which is particularly problematic for networks positioned to become systemically important administrative infrastructure with a very large user base.

{ did anyone follow the OKEx saga? }

The OKEx cryptocurrency exchange, based in malta, has [suspended](https://www.coindesk.com/okex-suspends-withdrawals) all cryptocurrency withdrawals because a key-holder is indisposed, because they are "currently cooperating with a public security bureau in investigations". The suspension was [still](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/okex-withdrawal-suspension) in place a week later, despite a whale alert and social media furore about a large transfer to Binance, but this turned out to be [mislabelled](https://twitter.com/philip_gradwell/status/1317120228510359552).

{ other: regulations, privacy, security, fun }

US Department of Justice [released](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-william-p-barr-announces-publication-cryptocurrency-enforcement-framework) Cryptocurrency Enforcement Framework that provides an overview of the crypto space and its illicit uses, existing laws, and current challenges and strategies to address them. Similar to FinCEN [guidance](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf) from May 2019, the document is most relevant to custodial services.

Komodo [announced](https://komodoplatform.com/community-update-on-atomicdex-kyc-aml/) that they will be implementing KYC/AML procedures on the AtomicDEX liquidity network that is officially supported by the developers, even though the exchange is non-custodial. The announcement mentions another thing to worry about besides the recent regulatory action: "there is a buyback and token swap concerning security-like tokens that underpin AtomicDEX operations, including assets like DEX token, SuperNET assets, and any revenue-sharing token".

CFTC [charged](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8270-20) BitMEX owners for operating an unregistered trading platform and violating CFTC regulations, including failing to implement AML procedures.

FinCEN issued a $60M [fine](https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-fines-bitcoin-mixing-ceo-60m-in-landmark-crackdown-on-helix-coin-ninja) to the owner of a Bitcoin mixer who was arrested in February. The service was [custodial](https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-coin-mixers-legal-crosshairs/).

Coinbase released its first transparency [report](https://blog.coinbase.com/transparency-at-coinbase-c8edf6dce4d6) with a breakdown of law enforcements requests received in the first half of 2020.

PayPal [announced](https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-new-york-conditional-bitlicense-paxos-cryptocurrency) that it will allow users to buy BTC, ETH, BCH and LTC with its app. The initial version will not allow deposits, withdrawals, or sending cryto to other PayPal accounts. The company has a [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal) of arbitrarily frozen accounts and associated lawsuits.

Dustin Dreifuerst of [Did You Know Podcast](https://didyouknowcrypto.com/ep26/) warns of a [scenario](https://medium.com/@dustindreifuerst/the-coming-bitcoin-war-ff3e96db3aad) where an influx of institutional investment will lead to a conflict with principles crypto was founded on. { submitted in https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/147 , relevant enough? }

Tether [reversed](https://cryptobriefing.com/tether-can-freeze-destroy-your-usdt/) a $1 million transaction in September by a user who erroneously sent the funds to the DeFi platform Swerve.

The DeFi protocol harvest.finance was [hacked](https://cryptobriefing.com/hackers-drain-defi-protocol-harvest-finance-24-million/) for $24 million with a flash loan that manipulated the price of a stablecoin on Curve's Y pool. 

Missed last month, Andre Cronje (of YFI) [deployed](https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1310763506170499072) contracts for a new "Eminence" gaming platform, within a few hours $15 million had been deposited, and it was then all taken by a hacker. The attacker then [returned](https://www.coindesk.com/eminence-exploit-defi-compensated) $8 million to a YFI smart contract controlled by Cronje, and this was distributed to victims of the hack.

Popular DeFi character Blue Kirby is not popular any more, after a [rollercoaster](https://thedailygwei.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-blue-kirby-the) 3 months in which they went from 0 to 20,000 followers on twitter, got a job with Yearn earning $7k/month, sold 500 ETH worth of Kirby NFTs, and received 25 YFI from Andre Cronje himself. Things started going wrong for Kirby when they encouraged people to pile into the beta Eminence contracts which got hacked, got a little worse when they cashed in all their YFI and were called out, then there was an episode with some new "Off-Blue" tokens that Kirby was promoting which people found to be suspicious. Someone apparently threatened to doxx Blue Kirby, and they disappeared, deleting their accounts and leaving with an estimated $1 million.

Uniswap held the [first](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/1) and [second](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2) votes of its new UNI-based governance system, both failing with 97-98% approval but only Yes votes from 3.75%-3.96%, while the minimum quorum to pass is yes votes from 4% of the UNI tokens. The first proposal sought to lower the requirement for submitting a proposal (at present the proposer must have or be delegated at least 1% of all UNI) and for passing the quorum requirement (from 4% to 3%). The first two proposals were created by the same actors, including Dharma protocol and Gauntlet. The second proposal sought to extend the initial airdrop to Uniswap users who interacted with proxy contracts, with ~20% of the addresses to receive these tokens being Dharma users. This led some participants to [frame](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/urgent-discussion-on-current-vote-reduce-uni-governance-proposal-quorum-thresholds/7117) the proposals as a kind of takeover attempt.

GitHub has taken down the repository of the popular [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) project that allows to bypass all the UI nonsense and just get the video file from YouTube. For Decred this is a reminder of the risk to lose any GitHub data not sored in the Git repository, which is especially relevant for repositories like [dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) that have many design discussions and decisions stored in issues and pull requests outside of Git. The program can still be downloaded from its [website](https://youtube-dl.org/) (make sure the signatures are still valid) and used e.g. to backup Decred videos hosted on the centralized YouTube platform.

Samsung is [integrating](https://cryptonews.com/news/samsung-adds-anti-money-laundering-features-to-it-crypto-wal-7911.htm) AML checks into their phones to make everyone safe.

UK Government published an international [statement](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/international-statement-end-to-end-encryption-and-public-safety) on end-to-end encryption, co-signed by representatives from the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and Japan ([mirrored](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety) on the DoJ website). The statement calls for tech companies to inject backdoors for public safety. Matrix team posted a [response](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors/) explaining why compromising everyone's security and privacy to combat abuse by the minority of bad actors is fundamentally flawed and proposed alternative measures.
